  I think the role local police will be interesting for the Virus Bunny Apocalypse game. Since there are so many corruption in this game,
it need to be someone who can deal with corruption, each city have their own police and they can’t tell other people who they are, 
you need to hide your role in order to find the people that are corrupted. You can lie to other when they ask what is your role,
you can write anything on the name tag in order to earn their trust.
  The job of this role is to find the corrupt people and bring them to prison, the people who are captured will be eliminated from the game.
The local police can earn extra credit when capture someone who are corrupted. You need to pretend that you are the people that is 
corrupted and you can join the conversation of other to check they are corrupted or not, the most interesting thing of this character is 
you can’t expose yourself, if other people find out that you are the police then no one will trade with you. When the game started no one 
should know your identity and you should keep it that way.
  Each city has their own police, they can move anytime in the game, the winning condition of the local police is to prevent the corruption
, when the game is finished everyone should tell there were corrupted or not and if there is no corruption, all local police win. 
The goal is to capture all the corrupted people, you need to have enough evidence to prove a person that is guilty, like they give you
the money or recourse. When you have evidence, you can give them to GM and they will be captured. If you are good at hiding and convincing 
other people then this role will be very interesting.
